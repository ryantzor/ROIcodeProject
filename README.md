# ROIcodeProject
This is a prescreen exercise with ROIcode

# How to run and test the program

1. Launch Visual Studio and open the solution file and run the program. 

2. Alternatively you can build the application in Visual Studio, and navigate to the debug folder. Run the ROICodeproject.exe.

# Problem

Coding Exercise:
· Write a program in C# that converts a sentence from English to Inflationary English. Inflationary English takes words and word parts that sound the same as a number (e.g. “won” v. “one”) and then inflates that to the next number (e.g. “won” becomes “two”). Provide tests for your program.
          
·         Example of input and output:
·         Input: “Today I won an award for being awesome.”
·         Output: “Threeday I two an award five being awesome."
