Coding Exercise:
· Write a program in C# that converts a sentence from English to Inflationary English. Inflationary English takes words and word parts that sound the same as a number (e.g. “won” v. “one”) and then inflates that to the next number (e.g. “won” becomes “two”). Provide tests for your program.
